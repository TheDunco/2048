# 2048
2048 game for CS108 final project

**Run the GUI file**

Press "H" key or hit "Help" button for a help menu.

Note: I had to pass the "self" GUI Object to the Twenty48 object to make the animation work.
I realize it's bad practice to have two objects intertwined like that,
but it made coding it easier and it made it look better. 

**32152** is my high score, let me know if you beat it! (And no cheating!)
You can continue playing if you get the 2048 tile,
but it tends to slow down if played for a significant amount of time. 

You can contact me if you need to at *duncvan@gmail.com*

Hope you enjoy!
